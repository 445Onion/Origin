# Origin
This is my first attempt at creating a styled website using my current knowledge of html, css and flexbox.
Firstly, I plan to create the standard files of index.html and styles.css to start of the project.
Secondly, I aim to fill the contents of the page through adding the relevant items into index.html.
This part consists of a header, 4 sections, and a footer.
The header consists of a logo and 3 links.
The first section will have a left half, filled with a brief summary about Origin, and a right half with an img.
Second section will consist of some random information, as well as 4 flex boxes with img and captions.
Third section will have an intersting quote, and the fourth section will be decided when i reach there.
The footer will provide a small closure to the page by having my mark as the creator.
